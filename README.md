# go-cache
In memory cache server implemented with virtual nodes and consistent hashing (TBD which approach)

## Quick Startup

1. To run the service locally if `Go` is installed you can run the command
   ```bash
   go run ./server/main.go
   ```
   - This will spin up the `http` and `gRPC` service respectively.

## Dependencies

- [Buf](https://buf.build/docs/cli/installation/#__tabbed_1_1) - Used tool for go code generations for protobufs relating to `.proto` files for gRPC calls.

## Testing gRPC

To directly test against `gRPC` API call's we can use a tool called [grpcui](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcui?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

1. Use `grpcui` to interact with any internal or public gRPC calls:
   - This will require generating the `protoset` which can be done via buf
   ```bash
   buf build --path ./proto-public -o api.bin --as-file-descriptor-set
   ```
1. We can now use the generated `protoset` file called `api.bin` to send requests at our gRPC URL
   ```bash
   # Define your $GRPC_ADDR var
   grpcui -plaintext -protoset api.bin "$GPRC_ADDR"
   ```
